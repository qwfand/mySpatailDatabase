 create Portland Maps to give easy access to citizens

The system I  choose is called TransitTracker, it implement computers on board all of their buses. It need an centrlized database and all this infotmation about real-time location of the buses and our customer service department
able to build mapping applications that allow better-informed decisions 

this application is called PDX Bus, it is using GPS and service to tell you the bus which is arriving right now.
