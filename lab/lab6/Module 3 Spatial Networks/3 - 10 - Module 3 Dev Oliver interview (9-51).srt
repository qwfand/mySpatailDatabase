1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,660
Welcome back to the discussion
of spacial computing.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:09,290
Today, we are going to meet Dr.
Dev Oliver who has a computer science PhD.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,468
And he works with ESRI,
Environmental Systems Research Institute,

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:18,780
a company you have seen
before in our lectures.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,390
This company puts out a very popular
family of products called Arc GIS and

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,230
affiliated products.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,890
Which are used by millions
of people in the world.

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,790
And in some sense it
was starting mid 1960s,

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,320
this company has been really spreading
the word in popularizing the technology.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,630
So, le, let's come and meet Dev.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,474
Hello Dev.
[LAUGH]

12
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,960
>> Hey how you doin?

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,710
>> Oh great.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,280
It's very nice to see you again.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,410
>> It's good to see you again
thank you for having me.

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,510
>> Great.
Great and thanks for

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,880
taking the time to talk to all the
students in this spatial computing MOOC.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,970
I think they can, you know, share your
enthusiasm about spatial computing.

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,460
And learn about some of the, the real
things that you are doing at ESRI.

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,660
So first I wanted to ask you that,

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,830
you know, you have a broad
computer science background.

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,060
how, how did you,
get into spatial computing and

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,340
how did you get started there?

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,670
>> Well, from spatial computing,
from general computer sciences,

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,480
spatial computing.

26
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,877
The thing that draw, drew me was
the applications that were available.

27
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:27,300
So I remember using writing applications,
applications for

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,560
crayon mapping, applications for
outlaw detection and so on and.

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,690
Thinking this is wonderful, I want to
understand how these things work and

30
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,340
what are the underlying technologies.

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,040
So that's, that was sort of my pull

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,560
>> Wo, wonderful, and recently you moved
to a new area, in a Redlands, California.

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,250
With you know, as you joined ESRI.

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,250
Did you get to use any GIS
applications during your move?

35
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,120
>> Absolutely.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,890
I was using Google maps and

37
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,172
other online services just to try
to figure out where things are.

38
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:03,219
Looking for houses.

39
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,389
I'm using Zillow.

40
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:09,557
I'm using a lot of different spatial
technologies that are out there.

41
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:14,200
So it's just, spatial computing
is a part of my every day life.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,640
I can't do anything without,
without really.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,430
Every day I use it.

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,750
>> Wonderful.

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,100
So, so now as a spatial
computing professional with

46
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,049
an inside ESRI what kind of projects
are you working on now days?

47
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,280
So within ESRI,
I'm working on two primary projects.

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,960
The first has to do with spatial networks.

49
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,060
I'm working on a project for
a facility network.

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,700
And basically, it is providing
analytic capabilities, indexing.

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,310
Database capabilities to utility
companies such as electric, water,

52
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,610
gas, things of that nature, so that is
one, one aspect that I'm working on.

53
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,480
I've always been interested in
spatial networks, such as road and

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,660
transportation networks.

55
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,840
Now I get to work on spatial
networks in a different context.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,310
And this builds utility.

57
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:13,622
And the other job I'm working on is
a big data project here at ESRI.

58
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:19,361
So how can we sort of scale these
things up to larger data sets?

59
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,480
sort of the the focus of that project.

60
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,470
>> Okay, wonderful.

61
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,700
So spatial networks is something we
are discussing in this spatial MOOC.

62
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,340
You know, very basic around road networks.

63
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,760
How they are modelled at least
from academic perspective.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,470
And I believe you are familiar with the,

65
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,580
the textbook Chapter 6 on
spatial network in my book.

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,480
So could you maybe say a little bit
more on, you know, the way spa,

67
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,451
the database book, spatial database
book describes spatial network.

68
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:54,230
And the way ESRI's own software
think about spatial network.

69
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,590
What are the commonalities and
what are some differences?

70
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,170
>> So commonalities would include
the way spatial networks are modeled,

71
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,682
for instance.

72
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:09,420
I would say, you would model it using
like, a basic underline graph, and so on.

73
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,043
But the difference is even in, even in
the commonalities they are difference is.

74
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:20,150
At ESRI, they tend to be, the model and
a little bit more richer.

75
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:26,270
They try to capture different aspects that
are important to the utility companies and

76
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,610
so on, so.

77
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,870
An example be for instance if you have

78
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,450
features that are coincident,
>> Mm-hm.

79
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,961
>> Usually you know, in our,

80
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:41,180
in a traditional setting, doors would
be the features that are connected.

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,025
You go from edge a to b,
point a to point b on an edge, to point c.

82
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:46,770
>> Mm-hm.

83
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,890
>> But
maybe we can bring in other ideas such as

84
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:56,030
logically connecting entities rather than
just based on their physical coincidence.

85
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,180
So, they are, you know, the,
the basics are the same.

86
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,560
But there are some other things that,

87
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,130
from other directions the company
is trying to go into as well.

88
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,450
That's an example.

89
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,470
>> Wonderful.

90
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,500
So, maybe another, you know,
related questions, would be, what,

91
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,819
what are the software products ESRI
puts out to manage spatial networks.

92
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,790
So right now there is a net,

93
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:25,596
there is a geometric network
package that's available.

94
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:34,333
And I'm currently working on software
that is that is not out there yet.

95
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:39,380
But that was previewed at a user
conference this year in San Diego.

96
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,664
So, working with geometric network is a,
is an example of a software that.

97
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:50,852
Where that's currently out there
on the market, but it's not very.

98
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:54,311
I'm working on the one that
is going to succeed that one,

99
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,810
kind of eventually, over time.

100
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,410
We'll see.

101
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,280
By the way, I can't really claim anything,
I bought the,

102
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,705
the products and store
>> No, we, we understand.

103
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,030
[LAUGH].

104
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,630
Yeah, I understand you may have some
restrictions on what you can share.

105
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,820
But, you did mention the user conference,
right?

106
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,190
Each summer ESRI brings,
their users together.

107
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,220
And I assumed you attend this, this year.

108
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,940
So, how many people were
there at that conference, and

109
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,980
why should somebody come and
attend that, you know?

110
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,109
Okay.
>> So there's that this conf, this conf,

111
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,900
if you're into spatial computing,
you want to be at this conference.

112
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,172
This year, we had 16,000 people.

113
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:32,905
>> Wow.
16,000.

114
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:34,871
>> 16,000, yes.

115
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:39,690
Very vast, diverse backgrounds in,
in spatial computing.

116
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,040
So, yeah, we want to come
just to connect with people.

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,010
You want to see what
they're technologies are.

118
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,680
I want to understand what the problems
that real users are having, in,

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,480
in general, and not just related to ESRI.

120
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,300
But just in general whatever the real
world, problems they're trying to solve.

121
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,770
And, this is a great environment for that.

122
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,430
>> Yeah, well, won, wonderful.

123
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,220
Now going back to the big data
project you are working on,.

124
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,390
So we just saw that, you know,

125
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,890
White House had an announcement
on big data for climate.

126
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,634
And in fact,
Jack Dangermond from ESRI was there.

127
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,786
And he pledged a lot of help from ESRI.

128
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,720
So, can you tell us a little bit more
on the spatial big data projects

129
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,690
you're working on.

130
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,419
>> So [LAUGH].

131
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,142
The, the current, so

132
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:29,233
basically I am very limited in what I can
say about the spatial big data project.

133
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:33,144
Only to say that there is an open
source ESRI on Hadoop that is

134
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:39,272
available through GitHub right now, and
it offers, spatial indexing capabilities.

135
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:42,829
>> Okay.
>> Spatial data types for

136
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,100
big data on Hadoop.

137
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,690
>> Wonderful.

138
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,580
>> So that is currently one
thing that the team is going in.

139
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,498
>> And this.
So this is GIS on Hadoop right?

140
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:54,160
This is GIS on Hadoop, correct.

141
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,250
And this an active project
that's been contributed to.

142
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,250
>> Wonderful.
>> That would be a good starting place.

143
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,466
>> So, so do you think is that a big
prominent future directions for

144
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,801
spatial computing?

145
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:09,345
>> In general, I would say yes that
is a prominent spatial direction.

146
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:13,397
How do you, future direction for
spatial computing.

147
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:17,670
How do you draw large quantities
of spatial temporal data?

148
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,860
>> Okay.
>> How do you visualize it?

149
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,080
How do you analyze it?

150
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,240
These are some of the,

151
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,070
the big challenges that are
>> Okay.

152
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,730
>> Out there in this community right now,
as I see it.

153
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,970
>> Yeah, great.

154
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,675
So what are some other future
directions for spatial computing?

155
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:35,759
>> So, there are many.

156
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,561
But the one that I,
I kind of see popping up is,

157
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:45,480
sort of these analytic setups tailored
toward very specific domains.

158
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,990
An example would be, taking traditional
analytics techniques such as hotspots.

159
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,790
And tailoring them to, say,
road networks or to arbitrary shapes.

160
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,990
Rings, polygons, different types of things
like that, that suit a particular domains.

161
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,830
So, this is sort of another
angle that I see is is,

162
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,460
is coming in the future or
is probably even here already.

163
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,760
>> Already.
[LAUGH].

164
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,647
Wonderful, thank you so much, Dev.

165
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:20,969
You know and it's a coincidence that this
MOOC also has about 16,000 students.

166
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:25,665
Which is roughly similar to the number
of people coming to the conference.

167
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,230
