1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,025
Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial networks.

2
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:07,860
In our previous two videos, we primarily
looked at the multivision, and

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,630
we saw that spatial networks
are societally very important.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,200
Many of us already have already used
them in navigation applications on

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,670
our smartphone as well as on web
services like Google Maps, okay?

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,230
What we want to do now is to go under
the hood and see how these networks

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,790
are modeled computationally and then
how do we design scalable algorithms so

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,500
that we can compute spatial network
queries like shortest path very quickly,

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,705
even on roadmaps spanning the entire
country or the whole world, okay?

10
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:46,160
So at the end of this module,

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,040
we should be able to talk about
conceptual models of spatial networks.

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,140
In a later video module we'll
come back and look at logical and

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,060
physical model as well.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,130
And in particular we are going
to look at Graph models, okay?

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,390
That is something which has nice
mathematical properties, and

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,695
has been investigated in computer
science for a long time, and

17
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:12,160
it's a very popular computational
model of spatial networks, okay?

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,500
So the big picture,
essentially in this video and

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,030
the next two videos, we are going to look
at different models of spatial network,

20
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,700
in this particular case we
are looking at conceptual model.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,950
So we'll look at conceptual
model at two level,

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,860
one is the conceptual model
from database perspective,

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,460
It's often called the entity relationship
diagram and we saw a similar model in

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,600
spatial query chapter, describing the data
sets involving country, river, and cities.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,590
In this chapter,
we are going to describe road networks and

26
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,110
spatial networks using this too.

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,252
But the main focus would be to
understand the mathematical model

28
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:53,970
called graph because that's widely
used both in mathematics and

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,570
in software to model spatial networks.

30
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,720
After this video when we come back to next
video, we'll look at logical data model,

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,530
in some sense the facilities for creating
it, as well as physical data model.

32
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,860
How do we stores networks so that we can
scale up to very large networks, okay?

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,000
So without further ado,
let's take a look at one of

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,210
the spatial networks many of
us are familiar with, right?

35
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,690
Probably most of us have used road
maps in navigation application.

36
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,230
So here'd we are showing
a small picture office.

37
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,146
A tiny section of a road map near
the University of Minnesota in

38
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:30,550
an area called Dinky Town.

39
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,260
So, you might actually
recognize this cartography.

40
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,670
You know, very typical of Google Maps.

41
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,830
And here you see roads like 4th Street
which is sort of going from the right side

42
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,440
to the left side or 5th Street which
is going from left to the right.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,750
University Avenue which again,
going from East to West.

44
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,750
But you also see these avenues,
5th Avenue and 6th Avenue.

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,417
This is 5th and 6th which are going
sort of North-South direction.

46
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:03,350
Now, if you were to model this is using,
entity-relationship diagram,

47
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:09,340
then we often ask about the concepts which
people used to think about roadmaps.

48
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,020
So common concepts include the notion
of roads, streets, and avenues.

49
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,270
And we already illustrate, illustrated
many of those a few seconds ago, okay?

50
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,370
But in addition people talk
about road intersection, so for

51
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,650
example you know when you
look at University Avenue and

52
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,890
it intersects with 7th Avenue Southeast,
this may be an intersection, okay?

53
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,720
So here is another intersection, okay?

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,230
Where 6th Avenue and
5th Street intersect, okay?

55
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,020
Another common concept is segment.

56
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,860
Once we have the notion
of road intersection,

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,580
then people often decompose a road or
a street into smaller pieces.

58
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,380
So for example, you know if you
look at this intersection and

59
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,210
that intersection then the segment of
5th Street, just this little piece

60
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,275
that connects adjacent road intersection
is often thought of as a road segment.,

61
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,360
okay, and so on.

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Another concept that we will
use is the notion of turns.

63
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,210
And if you have driven in urban areas,

64
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,260
you might have encountered
many turn restrictions.

65
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,550
You know, it may say no left turn at this
intersection if you're coming from north,

66
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,650
or no right turn if you're
coming from south and so on.

67
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,002
Some of these turn restrictions may
be due to one-way nature of the road,

68
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:30,310
all right, and other may be imposed
just to make the traffic flow smoothly.

69
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,520
And so on, so there are many,

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,030
many concepts we used when
dealing with road maps.

71
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,990
And all these concepts can be put together
into an entity relationship diagram.

72
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,090
So we'll quickly show you
a very big picture, you know

73
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,060
high level set of concepts that hopefully
you know you have used before and

74
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,870
many of us use in day to day, life.

75
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,800
So first concept is road map.

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,550
You know, you may look at a large,
you know, paper map, or you may go to and

77
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,130
look at a digital map.

78
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,170
And this road map as we just talked about,
consists of many,

79
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,348
many road intersections, and
many road segments, okay.

80
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,210
So an entity relationship diagram,
you know, and

81
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,410
you'll see this chicken foot, it's saying
a road map has many road intersections.

82
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,050
And same way a road map
has many road segments,

83
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,500
each road segment may have two road
intersections that it connects, 'kay?

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,760
Other interesting concepts are those
of the notion of the streets and

85
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,510
roads themselves, which as you know
are being shown as a box here, and

86
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,520
they can be modeled as a sequence
of road segments, okay?

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,270
Turns may also be thought
of as something imposed on

88
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,580
a sequence of road segments, okay?

89
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,600
And same with routes.

90
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,580
If you have your favorite
route from home to work,

91
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,450
again that's often modeled as a sequence
of road segments and intersections, okay?

92
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,780
You know other ideas may
be points of interest.

93
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,630
On a road map,

94
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,280
often certain places of interest
are highlighted such as airports, right?

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,960
Or downtowns, schools, and these
are often part of this point of interest,

96
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,380
they often have an address.

97
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,350
In many countries, this address comes
in the form of street address, so you

98
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,770
may give the name of the street and then a
building number on that particular street.

99
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,430
But, you know, this is a new system,

100
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,860
it's only about 100 to 150 years old and
countries like England and

101
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,730
US have gone through a lot of
legislative process to systematize it.

102
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,580
But many other countries we
don't have street address and

103
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,200
there your address may
be much more simpler.

104
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,390
It may be based on a landmark but
if you have a smartphone and GPS,

105
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,480
you can simply provide the latitude and
longitude.

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,370
So these addresses may come in many forms,
okay, and so on.

107
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,960
Another concept that we may visit
later is the observational framework.

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,790
Nowadays we have lot of sensors on the
road, and these sensors may be static or

109
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,480
moving, and they observe different
properties of the road and so on.

110
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,950
And also in the map you need
some kind of coordinate system.

111
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,340
Latititude longitude is one in
order to specify these locations.

112
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,040
So they are showing you a rich site of
concepts people may use to model roads.

113
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,580
And you know, we have just given
you a few common concepts and

114
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,070
you can probably enrich this
diagram with more concepts.

115
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,850
So let's now switch gears and
look at the, the graph model, okay?

116
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,040
My entity-relationship
diagram was very rich.

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,250
It could model many, many concepts.

118
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,260
Graph is a much simpler model, okay?

119
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,230
So let's first look at its
mathematical definition and

120
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,710
then apply it to model roadmaps, okay?

121
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,070
So mathematically graph just is a pair.

122
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,330
Okay, it has two components,
a graph G has two components.

123
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,380
The first symbol, V, stands for
a set of nodes or vertices, okay.

124
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,290
The second symbol, E,
stands for a set of edges.

125
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,700
And they model one binary
relationship among vertices, okay.

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,600
So let's illustrate it to see, you know,

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,840
if you were to use this to model road map,
what would they look like?

128
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,970
So here is the road map we saw before,
which had many road intersections and

129
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,230
many road segments connecting them.

130
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,290
And one way to model it as a graph is to
use road intersections as the nodes, and

131
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,960
road segments connecting edges and
intersections as the edges.

132
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,960
And if you did that,
the graph model may look like this.

133
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,120
So here you notice, you know,
all these nodes and 7, and 4 and 5.

134
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,810
And these are modeling
road intersections here.

135
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,860
Just to show that correspondence
little bit easier let me

136
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,832
show you an overlay of these two
images and it may look like this.

137
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:32,260
So you now see these nodes that
we had in the graph they match up

138
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,940
with the road intersection.

139
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,590
And then the edges we have, they match
up with the road segments, okay?

140
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,230
So this is one way to model roadmaps and

141
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,340
graphs, and
it's a popular way to model that, okay?

142
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,018
It's often used for
computing shortest path, okay?

143
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:50,820
Now, now when you look
at this graph model and

144
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,850
you've tried to compare it with the
entity-relationship model we showed you in

145
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,450
the last, dia, slide,
you probably realized that this graph is

146
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,710
not modeling all the information in
that entity-relationship diagram, right?

147
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,290
So we can do a very quick big picture
comparison of the two models and

148
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,410
try to see the pros and cons, okay.

149
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,980
Before that, we'll also show you
another example of graph model.

150
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,810
If you remember the River Network that
we covered in the previous video,

151
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,360
where you had these major
rivers in United States, and

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,660
we had a relationship called falls into.

153
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,010
Okay, that may be modeled
as a graph like this.

154
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,220
So here,
River Mississippi is maybe node 1.

155
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:34,390
River Missouri maybe node, another node,
and this arrow might show you that this,

156
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,070
you know, large river falls
into another river, okay?

157
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,530
So graph models can be used to model
different spatial networks, but

158
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,330
they are simple, okay?

159
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,370
So going back to the road example, and

160
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,240
if you compare the entity-relationship
diagram for the roads, and the graph model

161
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,610
for the roads, here are the strengths and
weaknesses of graph models, okay?

162
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,630
So in terms of strength graph models
have very, very nice mathematics.

163
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,050
In fact there is a whole branch of
mathematics called graph theory

164
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,060
which has characterized many
properties of the graph and

165
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,840
it has classified graphs
into different kind.

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,460
And those properties can help us
reason about graphs very well, okay?

167
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,850
So, for example when we compute shortest
path, this mathematics can help us

168
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,740
tell whether the path returned by our
algorithm is indeed the optimal or

169
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,200
shortest path, or whether it is not, okay?

170
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,810
The second strength is that
the graphs have been very popular in

171
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,950
computer science.

172
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,180
And over the last 50 to 60 years,

173
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,710
computer scientists have designed very
nice algorithms to manipulate graph.

174
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,300
So you know, you,
you have enjoyed the fruits of those.

175
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,780
For example when you go to Google Maps and
compute shortest path,

176
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,720
you probably don't realize how big a graph
it is using to model road map of US.

177
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,210
Okay, that graph has billions of nodes,
and

178
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,660
yet the shortest path is
computed almost instantaneously.

179
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,510
You don't even feel the time it takes,
right?

180
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,560
So those are the nice computational
algorithms that have been designed over

181
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,620
the last 50, 60 years, and we can leverage
those if you use graphs as the model.

182
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,810
Okay, but what's the down side?

183
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,030
Okay, and here is the down side.

184
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,461
If you think about that entity
relationship diagram I showed you,

185
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:15,350
then graphs are modeling only
a small part of that, okay?

186
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,770
And to be more precise, they are modeling
only one binary relationship, okay?

187
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,990
So if you think of nodes as road
intersections then this relationship could

188
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,330
be that a road segment connects to
a different road intersection, okay?

189
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,620
But if you wanted to model another
relationship, okay, besides connect.

190
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,310
If you want to model, let's say, turn
restriction, then there is a quandary.

191
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,160
Okay, in a graph,
you can only model one relationship well.

192
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,100
Okay, so trying to model two
relationship adds complexity, and

193
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,575
I will illustrate that very quickly.

194
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:54,330
And in fact, in many traditional graph
theory and graph algorithm scores,

195
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,580
you know, asking for
a shortest path which minimizes turns or

196
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,780
has no left turn often confounds these
computer scientists because that's

197
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,060
a limitation of graph, okay.

198
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,270
Another implication of
this is the following.

199
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,980
Based on your preference for
the relationship, right,

200
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,780
in other words you know if you
look at your dominant queries.

201
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,210
And those, those queries are asking for
you know a different set of

202
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,995
relationships than the one
modeled by popular graph model.

203
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:24,199
Then, you have limitations.

204
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,460
Either you have to change
your graph model or

205
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,410
look for multiple graph models for
the same road network, okay?

206
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,430
So let's look at an example of both.

207
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,071
So let's first think about turn modeling,
and

208
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,560
we all note modeling turns
are important in road maps.

209
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,640
In fact you might have even seen a recent
New York Times story that a major

210
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,300
logistics company, UPS, you know,
they were looking for new ways to

211
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,490
minimize fuel consumption going beyond
what Google Maps can do for you.

212
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,010
And one of the insights they had was
that their trucks were spending a lot of

213
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,860
time idling on left turns
in the United States, okay?

214
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,240
If you were in Britain, and, you know,

215
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,350
it may be the right turns, but
usually the turns are asymmetric.

216
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,290
One turn usually is quicker because
you don't have to wait, and

217
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,050
the other turn you have to wait for the
opposite traffic to stop for you, okay?

218
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,360
And UPS noticed that and they redid
their routes to reduce left turns in

219
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,140
United States and it saved them
millions of gallons of fuel, okay?

220
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,900
So modeling turns
are important societally.

221
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
If you imagine everybody else doing that,
you know,

222
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,330
you could probably reduce fuel
consumption in a much bigger way.

223
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,460
But how do we model that, okay?

224
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,810
So, so if you want to model that,

225
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,860
there are a couple of
different approaches, okay?

226
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,560
One approach is to translate it back
to the basic relationship connects and

227
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,360
some people have tried that, but
it simply expands your graph a lot, so

228
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,000
let me illustrate that.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,440
So if you remember,
you know, this road map.

230
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,030
So you have many one ways here.

231
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,800
So, for example, if you think about this
road intersection between this one-way and

232
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,990
a two-way,
then there are turn restrictions.

233
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,740
For example, you know,

234
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,630
going this, up, like this, we cannot turn
right, right, because that's a one way.

235
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,170
So if you want to model that, you know,
you know, enter, so then what we can do is

236
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,040
to take the intersection N5, modeling
this place, and expand it further.

237
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,980
Okay, expand it further
into a bigger graph, okay?

238
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,080
And in that graph you will have many,

239
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,870
many extra edges modeling
all possible turns, okay?

240
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,680
So, so in this graph, you know,

241
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,140
if, let's say you're going on this
one way, it is going up here.

242
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,950
Then you know, this will allow you
to turn in different direction.

243
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,020
It can take a right turn and you can,
you know, take a left turn, okay?

244
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,400
However if I was going on this road, okay?

245
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,960
If I'm going on this road which
are these two edges, then, you know,

246
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,480
I have a right turn available,
but there is no left turn.

247
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,820
I cannot go back this way.

248
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,430
So that is just missing, okay?

249
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,520
So this is one way to model the turns.

250
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,240
And in this case, your sight of nodes and
edges grows a lot.

251
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,950
So essentially this node N5 now has
been replaced by six different notes and

252
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,770
a bunch of edges, okay?

253
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,760
So if you were to do that,
your graph size will go up.

254
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,315
In addition, doing this is still,
you know, for no U-turn is harder, okay,

255
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:10,223
because U-turn involves actually
a sequence of more than two edges,

256
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,410
it's three edges.

257
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,260
So, it's a little harder here, okay?

258
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,740
So, there are some other approaches,
as well.

259
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,350
You know, ideally,

260
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,710
we should switch to another notion
called hyper-graphs and hyper-edges.

261
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,960
If you want to model U-turns, you may
have to model three edges, and so on.

262
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,129
And that is very hard to model in
regular graphs but hyper-edges and

263
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,900
hyper-graphs can do that.

264
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,180
Another approach is to
actually go beyond graphs.

265
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,110
So whether you use graphs or
hyper-graphs, we can actually annotate,

266
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,570
we can add some additional information
to nodes like N5, the whole table.

267
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,530
Which lists all possible turns that
there are delays and restrictions.

268
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,460
And this is something commercial
systems like ESRI, have been,

269
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,340
you know have gone this way, okay?

270
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,370
But again the main point is that modeling
multiple relationships is difficult and

271
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,780
we illustrated that by showing
you the example of turn, okay?

272
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,490
Now another implication is that you know,
if you take a single spatial road,

273
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,540
you know, spatial network,
such as a road map, then it has, you know,

274
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,630
many, many different relationships.

275
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,340
And depending on your workload, or

276
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:21,330
your application, the priorities of those
relationships may be different, okay?

277
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,440
So depending on, you know,

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,280
your favorite relationship,
the graph model will also change.

279
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,060
Okay, so for the same roadmap you
may see many different graph models.

280
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,240
And we're going to show
you a couple of those.

281
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,210
The first one is the traditional one,

282
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,740
okay, where the nodes represented
road intersections, and

283
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,360
the edges represented these road segments
connecting edges and road intersection.

284
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,530
Okay, this is a very popular one.

285
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,762
And if you need to learn
only one graph model for

286
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:49,370
road maps this is the one
I will recommend, okay?

287
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,620
But we did see another choice.

288
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,170
You know,
if you were to model turns, okay,

289
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,690
if you really were really interested in
modeling turns, you were working for UPS.

290
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,310
And that's what, you know, your
application was to minimize left turns

291
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,780
then what we could do is to use
edges to model turn relationships.

292
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,490
But then your nodes may switch from
road intersections to road segments,

293
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,760
because turns are relationships between
road segments, which are adjacent, okay.

294
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,450
Of course, you know,
you can have a third one, and

295
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,410
this model will remind you of the model
we used for the river network.

296
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,830
You know, we could use,
actually, other types of nodes.

297
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,990
So, for example, like, streets and
avenues may be thought of as roads.

298
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,620
And the relationship may
be that intersects, okay?

299
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,270
Now this kind of a model
is sometimes used for

300
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,180
cartographic generalizations of road maps,
okay?

301
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,910
So if you have a very large city,
you know,

302
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,030
with many, many roads and
then you have to zoom out, and you

303
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,120
have to only show a subset of the roads
otherwise your picture may be cluttered.

304
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,010
So in order to identify the major roads,

305
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,090
which should be shown, this third
representation may be of interest.

306
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,760
Because you often prefer
the roads which have,

307
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,300
which cover many other smaller streets,
you know, which they intersect with, okay?

308
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,480
So again, to summarize what we
looked at were conceptual and

309
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,900
information models for roadmaps.

310
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,890
And we saw that at a detailed information
level called entity-relationship diagram

311
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,680
where we can represent many,
many concepts in roads,

312
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,290
such as streets, road intersections,
you know, road segments, turns, et cetera.

313
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,650
Then we looked at graph models which
are nice clean mathematical model and

314
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,480
also have been used in computer science
to design many scalable algorithm.

315
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,410
And we looked at the pros and
cons of graph models.

316
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,390
So even though it has very
nice mathematical and

317
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,480
computational properties,
it has limitations.

318
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,150
It can only model one relationship.

319
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,240
And you have to choose which one.

320
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,740
Okay?

321
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,590
And based on your application, if you
are doing cartographic generalization you

322
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,790
may choose nodes and edges in one way.

323
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,870
If you are doing some shortest path,
you may choose them in a different way.

324
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:53,730
So, with this,

325
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,490
we'll wrap up the discussion of
conceptual models of street networks.

326
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,200
When we come back, in the next segment,
we will look at logical models and

327
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,180
look at query languages for,
spatial networks.

328
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,180
And then we'll follow it up with
another video on the physical model,

329
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,210
the data structures and
algorithms of spatial network.

330
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,670
So look forward to seeing
you in the next few videos.

331
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,170
Thank you.
