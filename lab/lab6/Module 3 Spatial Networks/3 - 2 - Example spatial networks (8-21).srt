1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,060
Welcome back to the discussion
of spacial networks.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,850
In previous video,
we looked at the societal motivation for

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,370
studying spacial network and
we saw that there are many,

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,510
many use cases,
particularly in an urban society.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,120
All of us use navigation, for

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,600
example, on either a web-based or
smart phone based platform, okay?

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,970
We also saw the limitations, and we argued
that the spacial equating we learned so

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,050
far in the previous week is not
adequate to model these queries on

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,800
spacial networks, okay?

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,980
In this video segment,
we have very modest goal.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,420
We are just going to look at three simple
examples of spatial networks, okay?

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,312
And these will be used for
running examples through all this module.

13
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:47,190
So, when we come back in later videos,
we will often see these networks and

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,310
associated queries being used to
illustrate various ideas, okay?

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,990
For example, when we introduce the graph
model, we'll show you the graph

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,190
representation of three example networks
from this particular module, okay?

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,570
So at the end of this video, we should
all be able to describe at least three

18
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,420
simple spatial networks and
a few queries associated with that, okay?

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,170
So let's look at the first one,
which is already quite familiar to us, and

20
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,820
this is a road network.

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,950
So on the left we are giving you a very
simple view of road networks, with major

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,720
roads in the city of Minneapolis where,
you know, city of Minnesota is located.

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,770
It also has, you know, two routes.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,950
So you kind of see a blue line and
a red line, and they are representing two

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,410
kinds of shortest path between this upper
left corner and lower right corner.

26
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,160
The, as you can guess, the red line
is probably shortest distance but

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,910
the blue line is shortest travel time
as it takes advantage of the freeway.

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,686
Highway 94 in this case, okay?

29
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:49,060
So types of queries yet, again,
are probably familiar to you.

30
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,400
The very fast one we already talked about.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,370
We may ask for a shorted path.

32
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,230
So given a starting location, maybe in
Residio, Minnesota, and a destination,

33
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,400
maybe the airport, we may ask, what is the
shortest path to reach there, either for

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,520
distance or travel time and so on, okay?

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,060
But there are other queries of interest.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,510
Again, you know, like location-based
services, if you have access to that.

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,862
You could also ask for near, nearest
instance of facilities from our location.

38
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:21,930
Let's imagine you were in computer science
building at University of Minnesota and

39
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,960
it is lunch time, and you are looking for
any rest, you know, restaurant.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,480
You could ask for that query.

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,167
Or, for some reason, you wanted to
get a flu shot, you could ask for

42
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,932
the nearest hospital and so on.

43
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:37,850
A third query may be including
a set of destinations.

44
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,560
So we saw this from the business
context in network analysis.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,900
Here, you know it's there may be a
starting point like a store and they have

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,300
to deliver a set of, you know, furniture
to many, many houses and they may ask for

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,510
a route, which covers all theses houses
and minimizes the total distance, okay?

48
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,480
And, finally, you know,
we also looked at allocate query.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,880
So, let's say you have a set
of service centers maybe many,

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,275
many retail stores, and you have a set of,

51
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:09,310
of customers, and you are assigning
customers to the nearest store.

52
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,380
So, you could define service areas or

53
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,420
number of customers likely to easiest
reach your store and so on, okay?

54
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,060
All right, so let's switch and
look at a very different network,

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,220
which may be less familiar to
some of us if, unless you live in

56
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,950
urban area which has public transportation
such as train networks, okay?

57
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,470
So here,
we are showing you a subway network.

58
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,000
In Minneapolis areas right now,

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,690
we have a very simple network,
just one line, so it's not as interesting.

60
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,770
In next few years,
we may have more lines and use that.

61
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,360
So we are showing you a network
from San Francisco area.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,340
It's called BART, and it has, you know, in
this map, it's showing four lines, okay?

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,900
So you can kind of see one line going from
top right to bottom left, and so on, okay?

64
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,250
The colors are not shown, but

65
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,310
they are listed in the text,
if you could zoom in you will see.

66
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,360
So, you know, this particular
route is Yellow West, you know,

67
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,690
it's shown in yellow arrow here.

68
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,480
And then one could do a very
simple aggregate query here.

69
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,730
You could say on Yellow West route, tell
me how many stations are located, okay?

70
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,999
So one could count and
see how many route, you know,

71
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:17,105
stations these, shown as black
dots are covered by this, okay?

72
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:23,386
Another query, you know, may have
to do with a particular stop, okay?

73
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:26,750
So in subway network usually you
have routes and you have stop.

74
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,473
And one interesting stop here is Berkeley,
downtown, which is number two.

75
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:33,070
It's shown as that red square here.

76
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,140
And we may ask questions like, you know,

77
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,940
which other stops are reachable
from Berkley, okay?

78
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,370
Hopefully, if it is a rich network it

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,910
would reach all of them
by switching trains.

80
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,160
So, you could ask whether
you can reach it directly or

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,750
do you have to change trains, okay?

82
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,550
Now, in addition to that, you could
still do the shortest path queries.

83
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,514
So, here we are showing you another
destination called Daley city, and

84
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:55,510
here is Berkeley.

85
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,500
And you could ask, give me the routes
which connect a particular start point

86
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,830
such as Downtown Berkeley and
a destination such as Daley city.

87
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,790
Okay and then finally,
we could ask for, you know,

88
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,120
some other aggregate
queries on certain routes.

89
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,240
So here is a blue route, Blue West,
and we can ask for the first stop or

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,050
last stop, okay?

91
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,450
So these are subway
network kind of queries.

92
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,956
Let's look at a third network.

93
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:23,910
And again, you know, if you, unless you
have worked with natural resources or

94
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,840
you're a geography enthusiast
it maybe a little bit new, okay?

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,118
So here we are showing you
a natural network of rivers.

96
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:35,150
You know this map is showing you some of
the major rivers in the United States.

97
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,090
For example, Mississippi River
starts in the state of Minnesota,

98
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,090
and then kind of flows south to
New Orleans and then Gulf of Mexico, okay?

99
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,220
But on the way it pick up
water from many tributaries.

100
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,370
So on the way it pick up from Missouri,
Colorado, Platte and so on, okay?

101
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,178
Oh, not Colorado,
Colorado was the other way.

102
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,310
But, you know,
you have a set of river networks and

103
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,070
it's interesting to know which river
falls into which other river and

104
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,965
that could be modeled as
a spatial network, okay?

105
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:06,840
So, types of queries here may
be of the following kind.

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,810
So you could ask, you know,
for a river Mississippi.

107
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,200
You know, list all the other rivers
which contribute water to Mississippi,

108
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,360
which are tributaries to Mississippi.

109
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,880
And in this answer, Colorado will not be
included, because it goes the other way.

110
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,080
But you will have Missouri and
other rivers, okay?

111
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,450
We may ask other questions,
because sometimes, you know,

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,450
these rivers may contribute
water directly by falling or

113
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,740
merging with a river or
sometimes they may be indirect.

114
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,280
So, you could separate them out and
just ask for direct tributaries, okay?

115
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,730
Now if you're interested in,
in emergency management and

116
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,130
so on, then a common query is to,
you know, take care of pollutions.

117
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,850
So sometimes you have train lines or
there are other incidents,

118
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,310
there are farms next to rivers, and
occasionally, accidents happen, all right?

119
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,820
So you may have a oil spill, or a
fertilizer spill and then people want to,

120
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,250
essentially, inform everyone
downstream about water quality.

121
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,230
In case they were using it for
drinking water or

122
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,815
other uses, they may have to take
precaution and stop that, right?

123
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:11,980
That there has been similar incident
in east coast North Carolina recently.

124
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,580
so, so given a particular spill,

125
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,430
we may want to ask a question about
all the rivers that may get affected.

126
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,150
And then from there,
you can inform the communities, okay?

127
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,210
So this is a third kind of network and
slightly different questions.

128
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,620
So just to sum up, you know,
we saw three different spatial networks.

129
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,750
A road network, a train network,
and a river network.

130
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,930
And on each we saw some questions, okay?

131
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,220
And these were mixed questions.

132
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,270
Some of them required
transitive closure and

133
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,272
recursion and will need new knowledge
that we will learn in this chapter.

134
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:51,520
And somewere very simple like aggregate
queries that you could have answered using

135
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,830
spatial query.

136
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,830
And it may be a good exercise for
you to go back to those questions and

137
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,930
ask yourself which of these you can
answer easily using spatial query, and

138
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,850
where do we need new knowledge.

139
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,790
So well, this we'll wrap up
this particular video segment.

140
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,420
When we come back,
we'll introduce mathematical model and

141
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,930
information model for spatial networks.

142
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,620
So that you can answer all
of these queries, okay?

143
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,300
So looking forward to seeing you in the,
the next set of video segments.

144
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,999
Thank you.
