1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,650
Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,200
With this video,
we start a new module on Spatial Networks.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,420
So at the end of the first
video we have two objectives.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,630
All of us should be able to describe the
societal importance of spatial networks.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,460
Why we are studying this,
who can benefit and so on.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,710
And in addition, we also want to discuss
the limitations of spatial querying that

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,550
we discussed earlier in context of spatial
networks and their applications, okay.

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,960
So, let's first look at spatial
networks and where they come from.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,410
A very classical use case is navigation.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,278
So navigation pertains to finding
routes to a particular destination,

11
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:55,062
and that navigation is really you know,
as old as humans, right.

12
00:00:55,062 --> 00:01:00,199
So, you know, when humans, they had
not settled down for agriculture and

13
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,840
so on, they still had to go find food and
water and other things.

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,960
And they had to probably remember routes,
very much like how elephants and

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,524
other migratory species do that today,
okay.

16
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:18,184
Once humans settled, then you will still
see the notions like treasure hunt, right.

17
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:23,771
Even Columbus, you know, when he came to
West Indies or what we call America today,

18
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:28,352
was looking for trade routes to
to get spices from India, okay.

19
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:32,213
So again, knowing the routes were very,
very important for different kind of

20
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,662
trades, and there were well known
routes like silk route over land and

21
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,610
people are finding routes over ocean.

22
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:45,175
Another important group which deals with
navigation a lot is you can say Defense or

23
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,900
Armed Forces, right.

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,600
So they again, need to have
many different kinds of routes.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,345
So if they have a particular target,
they need to find a stealth route to

26
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:56,640
reach there without getting
detected by the adversary.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,052
And even if they are not looking for
target if,

28
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:03,030
if just, you know, the units are placed
somewhere, they need to get food and

29
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,370
supplies to the troops and for
that they need supply routes.

30
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,470
So routes and navigations are, you know,

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,720
very, very core activities
in human society, okay.

32
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,248
But more recently, you know,
this has come to all of us and

33
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:21,723
you can probably recognize the next
set of examples much quicker, okay.

34
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:28,100
So probably, you know, many of you use
these navigation apps on smartphones.

35
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,640
Using which you can essentially find
a route to your friends place or

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,600
to work or school.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,341
Before smartphone apps were popular,
we were also had dedicated devices,

38
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,350
sometimes called GPS devices.

39
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,730
So you kind of see a picture
of this GPS device.

40
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,730
People who go off-road, you know,

41
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,700
where you may not have cellphone signal
as readily available, may still use that.

42
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,950
So people who do hiking and boating,
they still use the dedicated devices.

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,470
And these devices are also being
imbedded in many other areas.

44
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,110
So for example, many modern cars
have a navigation system in their

45
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,710
instrument board and
people use that, okay.

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,844
So you probably know that, you know,

47
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:11,471
using these devices, you can very
easily find routes and locations, okay.

48
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,620
Also another platform is World Wide Web.

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,175
So beginning mid 90s,
you have services, such as MapQuest.

50
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:21,200
And in the last decade,
you have Google Maps.

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,870
So you could actually from
your desktop computer or

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,370
tablet, you know, go onto World Wide Web
and also do routing, okay.

53
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,620
So these things tell us
many different things.

54
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,550
So first, you know, if you are in a new
place and you just want to see what's

55
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,780
around you, they can display a map
around the current location.

56
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,740
And they can also compute inner distance.

57
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,500
They can find you routes to
a destination and so on, okay.

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,990
So navigation systems are often built
around what we call spatial networks.

59
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,280
For example, in these cases we
are looking at road networks.

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,470
But you could also use public
transportation, such as train and

61
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,092
so on and find routes across those, okay.

62
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:01,530
All right, so

63
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,210
let's let's look at another category
of application, which is very similar.

64
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,360
So broadly, what we saw in navigation
system audio smartphone app

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,470
are all, you know,

66
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,670
part of a general category of services
called Location Based Services, okay.

67
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,850
So within Location Based Services,

68
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,560
there are many different kinds of
questions that can be answered.

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,052
So very first question is,
where am I, okay.

70
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:28,824
In outdoor world,
one can get that through GPS, but

71
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:31,749
indoor there are other kind of sensors.

72
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,910
Okay, if you are you know,
in tunnel and so

73
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,980
on, they're may be different
sensors that tell you that.

74
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,110
But there is a very simple
software interface.

75
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,680
So using a simple function call,
we can find the location.

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,670
And these locations
come in multiple forms.

77
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,390
So most of us are used to symbolic
place names, so a street address.

78
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,740
The computer science building in
the University of Minnesota may have

79
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,550
a street address such as 200 Union Street,
Southeast Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.

80
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,760
Or you may have another symbolic name
such as Mall of America and so on.

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,650
But there is anoth, a different
system which is numerical system.

82
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,940
So these symbolic street addresses can
be converted to numerical systems,

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,680
such as latitude, longitude.

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,750
So, if you are Goog, using Google Earth
web service, you will often see that.

85
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,410
And also if you have seen
the readings from your GPS, they

86
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,420
often start their life in this numerical
form, latitude, longitude as an example.

87
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,140
So these services also allow you to
translate between symbolic form,

88
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,940
such as street address and numerical form,
and that service is called Geocoding.

89
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,520
You could also go other way.

90
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,550
So if you just have a latitude,

91
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,600
longitude, you could ask then symbolic
place name for that particular place.

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Maybe it's a well known point
of interest or a city, okay.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,460
A second category of service is
broadly called directory service wh,

94
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,430
where you can ask what's around me.

95
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,164
So it could be as simple as asking for
nearest instance of a service.

96
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:03,060
Let's say, you want to locate a doctor or
clinic, you can go and ask for

97
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,210
nearest clinic from your current location,
or a particular location of choice, okay.

98
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,327
You can ask for a restaurant or,
you know, taxi and so on.

99
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:15,255
In addition,
you could also ask a range query so

100
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:20,234
you could essentially say, well, if I am
willing to walk a mile along the roads or

101
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:24,139
drive a mile what are the instances
of banks within a mile.

102
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,500
And you can then choose the ones
which is most convenient, okay.

103
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,389
And the last part of this is route okay,

104
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,633
which you have seen in
navigation quite a bit.

105
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:35,190
Once you have selected an instance of
a service, you can ask how do I get

106
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,520
there either walking or driving or through
public transportation and so on, okay.

107
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,390
And location based services as
a segment has been growing quite a bit.

108
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,270
Besides the consumer application there
are many, many business applications where

109
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,060
businesses ask questions
of their own interests.

110
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,170
And I will show some of those very
soon under network analysis, okay.

111
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,232
Okay, now going beyond the,

112
00:06:57,232 --> 00:07:01,810
you know, the current consumer services
such as location based services.

113
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,980
You can ask who else in the society
cares about spatial networks and

114
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,200
the key thing to note,
which is what this slide is telling you.

115
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,690
Is that if you are in any urban area,
you know, there are many,

116
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,580
many very critical spatial
networks of interest, okay.

117
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,150
So, this is actually showing you critical
infrastructure listed by Department of

118
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,600
Homeland Security, and
let me point out some of them, okay.

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,130
Very first one was transportation,
which is what we had been talking about so

120
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,340
far but, you know.

121
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,310
Next, you can go look at energy,
if you think about electricity supply.

122
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,210
Okay, the electricity is carried through
different electricity network from

123
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,660
the generation capacity to your home.

124
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,630
And again, you know, people have
to keep track of that network for

125
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,070
many different reasons.

126
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,210
One of which is to protect
against adversaries, all right.

127
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,700
Or if, you know, certain fault happens,
if there was a storm and power lines went

128
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,560
down, they still need to track them on
geography and go repair them, okay.

129
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,200
So, you know, there are similar networks
for gas, the cooking gas that comes to

130
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,360
most houses again,
comes through a network of pipelines.

131
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,489
Oil is transported often
through pipelines.

132
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,641
Another network is water, okay.

133
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:11,040
In most urban areas,
the water is piped, right.

134
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,211
So there is a central
place where water tank or

135
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:16,850
water is located and
then it comes through pipes to all homes.

136
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,230
Even broader the, you know,
there are river networks and so on.

137
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,190
So, this water flows along different
networks that people have to monitor.

138
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,530
One last example, which many of
us relate to is communication.

139
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,190
We all use internet,
which is another kind of spatial network.

140
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,430
In past, people were not paying attention
to the locations of these switches.

141
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,470
But now,
there is a lot more awareness of that.

142
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,800
And particularly for cellphone, which can
move around if you want to tap internet.

143
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,670
Then, you know, your internet companies
have to keep track of where it is and

144
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,910
route things properly and
geography plays a role, and so on.

145
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,610
So essentially, if you are in
an urban setting, there are lots and

146
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,400
lots of these spatial networks
which are of interest.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,462
And people, you know,
use them in different ways,

148
00:08:57,462 --> 00:08:59,489
ask different questions, okay.

149
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:03,560
All right so, you know so
there are many societal applications.

150
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,470
Now the big question is, you know,
do we already know enough?

151
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,922
You know, we had a whole week on spatial
query, and we saw lots of spatial,

152
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:14,750
you know, data types and
different kind of querying in SQL.

153
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,430
And the big question is,

154
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,380
you know, does that already
cover all this spatial network?

155
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,200
Do we really need to spend another
week learning new computational ideas

156
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,180
here, okay.

157
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,330
So this slide essentially telling
you that, what we learned so

158
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,910
far is not adequate, okay.

159
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,640
So first, you remember, you know,

160
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,950
we learned OGIS Simple Feature Types which
provided us points, linestrings, polygons.

161
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,380
So, key thing to notice is that
those data types model geometry.

162
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,540
They do not model street
network very well, where you

163
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,015
need slightly different data types, you
know, as the mathematical model of graphs.

164
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:52,030
Okay, if you want to compute shortest
path, then you need those operators and

165
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,740
a new data type called graphs
which are missing, okay.

166
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,060
Same way in SQL, you know,
we learn joins and many different things.

167
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,830
But you have to realize that
shortest paths cannot easily be

168
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,400
expressed using these joins, okay.

169
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,360
They belong to a special category of
operations called transitive closure.

170
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,844
And there is a well known critical result
that your basic relational algebra or

171
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:18,180
basic SQL cannot expressive transitive
closure set as shortest path.

172
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,980
And I will show you many other
examples of that on the next slide.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,290
Now there is some good news in SQL real,
starting SQL3 recursion was added,

174
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,330
which can allow you to express
some of these queries.

175
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,760
Of course, the performance is still
something people are working on,

176
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,098
but you can express some of
these queries there, okay.

177
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:39,440
So, let's go down and
look at these network analysis queries.

178
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,362
And this is now giving you
the business side of spatial network,

179
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:46,204
what many businesses do with this, okay.

180
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:49,471
So one part, you know, the first thing
businesses do is very similar to

181
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,060
what consumers do, which is routing, okay.

182
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,710
So often times, you know, let's say,
you know, a business has to ship some

183
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,770
item from a factory to a warehouse, and
they want shortest path for that, okay.

184
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,720
So that is very simple.

185
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,370
So they just wanted to know how to get
some items from factory to a warehouse.

186
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,315
But usually their queries
are a little bit more complex,

187
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,469
which some of us might have experienced.

188
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,212
That, you know,

189
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:16,560
they might not have one destination,
they have multiple destination, okay.

190
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,360
So these routes get a little
more combinatory and

191
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,830
interesting, because you may also have
to choose the order of destination.

192
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,215
So again, try to imagine, you know you may
have a warehouse eh, store like Sears or

193
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:31,810
Walmart, where many people came and they
ordered some appliances, like washers or

194
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,120
dryers, right.

195
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,660
Next, you know, morning, the drivers
basically get a collection of five or six

196
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,740
of these deliveries, and they have to go
and deliver that within couple of hours.

197
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,530
So it's important to know in which
order these should be delivered and

198
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,270
what route, okay.

199
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,647
So this is a very typical query.

200
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:51,040
Another query is in terms of allocation.

201
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,462
So many businesses has many,
many stores, right.

202
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,457
If you think about a post office, it has
many different locations, right, and

203
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:59,170
then they have many customers.

204
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,556
So a big question for them is to allocate
customers to service centers, okay.

205
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,840
And in, you know, reverse of this
is to designate service areas for

206
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,930
each service center, okay.

207
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,330
And finally, there is a third
question called site selection.

208
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,130
So let's say, they wanted to add a new
service center because customers have now

209
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,260
grown in a certain area.

210
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,340
Then, you know, they want to essentially
ask which are the best locations.

211
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,122
So that you might minimize distance to
the new customers to solve that, or

212
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,502
you might minimize some other things,
okay.

213
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:35,367
Now again, you know, this list of queries,
they all belong to this graph-based

214
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:40,820
questions, and almost all of them
include transitive closure recursion.

215
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,840
So expressing these using simple joins,
select and

216
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,050
project, what we learn in spatial
querying before, is not possible.

217
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,130
So we need to learn new things.

218
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,850
So as we go along in this chapter,
we'll learn about graph data types and

219
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,060
the algorithms and
how we handle these kind of queries, okay.

220
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,340
So again, to sum up, you know,

221
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,140
we talked about spatial networks,
their societal importance.

222
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,000
Who uses them and

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,910
we saw consumer applications, business
application, government application.

224
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,240
And we also discussed the limitations
of spatial querying in

225
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,350
supporting such questions.

226
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,610
And as the chapter goes by,

227
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,320
we'll come and learn new things
to represent these queries.

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,865
Thank you and I look forward to
seeing you in the next segment.

229
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,544
