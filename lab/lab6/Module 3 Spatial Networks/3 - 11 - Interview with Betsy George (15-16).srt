1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,710
Welcome back to the discussion
of spatial computing.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,310
Today we are going to meet Dr.
Betsy George, at Oracle Spatial and

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:14,930
share and learn from her, you know the
excitement of spatial computing at Oracle,

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,930
a popular product which we have
mentioned several times in this course.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,800
Okay?

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,190
So please say hello,
to Doctor Betsy George.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:22,950
>> Hi.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,960
>> So Betsy, you know the first question
we wanted to ask you is, you know,

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,480
coming from a broad mathematics and

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,340
computer science background, how did
you get started with spatial computing?

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,820
>> I came into spatial computing
through my interest in graph theory.

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,920
So graphs.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,300
I have always been impressed with them.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,500
Expressiveness and
the simplicity of the model called graph.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,620
And so I got introduced to graphs
at the very early stage and

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,850
then, I was looking at, when I was
starting my research I was looking for

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,785
some real world applications of graphs.

18
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:58,600
>> Mm-hm.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,270
>> So then I got introduced
to transportation networks,

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,820
which are basically spatial networks and
and my first familiarization

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,230
with transportation at work was through
a study of evacuation planning algorithms.

22
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,990
And so when I studied the problem,
a little bit,

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,750
I realized the challenges that the real
world application domains brought,

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,210
to this world of graph theory,
and I was really excited and

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,910
impressed by the way, we needed to
re-evaluate the algorithms with.

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,950
In terms of the assumptions that we made,
when we designed graph algorithms.

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,810
>> Okay.

28
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,600
>> We needed to reformulate them
to suit the applications better.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,280
To be more specific in terms of the
evacuation planning algorithm the aim was

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,766
to evacuate the people as
fast as possible, so for a,

31
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:54,710
from the graph theory perspective,
that would immediately you know,

32
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,580
let me choose the shortest path, or the
fastest path, algorithm, and apply that.

33
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,840
But, then I realized that
that's not going to work,

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,020
because the roads have capacities and
you cannot push everybody to move,

35
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,500
along the same shortest path possible
from the source to the destination.

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,240
So, we needed to take care of the capacity
constraints, which is not really.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,010
Taken into account in any of the,
shortest path algorithms that I knew of.

38
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,630
So that was one example, where graph
theory really met the real world

39
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,790
application and
that opened up a lot of possibilities for

40
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,897
interrogation of the assumptions that
we're behind the graph theory algorithms.

41
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:34,760
So.

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,170
To put it shortly, I was, I was,

43
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,070
I became interested in special
computing through special networks.

44
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,730
>> Okay.

45
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,870
>> And so then I started seeing the lot
of challenges that are raised by,

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,210
you know, the,
when you bring location into computations.

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,410
>> Okay.

48
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,840
>> And how to effectively use that, and

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,630
so, it's been,
it's been a really exacting journey.

50
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,390
We've started off, with spartial networks
which, which are like the real networks.

51
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,700
>> Oh.
Won, wonderful.

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,710
So in this course, you know,
we did discuss shortest path.

53
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,320
>> Okay.
>> And

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm guessing lot of people in this course,
have used services like Google Maps.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,210
>> Yes.
>> Or the GPS devices to find.

56
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,370
>> Sure.
>> Shortest path.

57
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,170
>> Sure.
>> So, it,

58
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,030
it may be nice to kind of briefly,
you know, re you know,

59
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,790
revisit the evacuation scenario.

60
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,770
So let's say everybody living
in Boston had to leave.

61
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,630
>> Sure.
>> Because of a major hurricane.

62
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,290
>> Sure.

63
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,960
>> And
if they all just went to Google, and

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,620
found shortest path to their destination,
maybe, in New York City or in Albany.

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,930
>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> What would go wrong?

66
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,230
I mean, why not do that?

67
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,160
>> Oh, you you will see, like,

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,392
cars backed up all the way to
the place where you started.

69
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:43,477
[LAUGH] Because, you know?

70
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,893
Everybody's going to drive out, and-

71
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,160
>> Okay.
You know, if you ask them to

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,406
move the fastest route possible, then you
know, everybody's going to be there and

73
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:55,660
you know like the roads will get congested
and the traffic will get backed up.

74
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,040
So you have to take care of you know,
the capacity as

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,081
the roads get used more and more.The
congestion increases the traffic time,

76
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:09,920
the travel time gets increased so that
fastest pack itself changes based on that.

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,925
So, that had to be taken into account.

78
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:13,950
>> Okay
>> So somehow, so

79
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,520
that added a new dimension to
the [INAUDIBLE] algorithm, so.

80
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,566
>> So, so, I guess graphs have been
extended to model age capacity, as well,

81
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:27,260
so is there like a general
family of graph models which.

82
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,810
>> Yes
>> Capacity into account?

83
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,310
>> Yes you know, for example my
research was actually to look at the,

84
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,320
the changes that the,
the graph can change,

85
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,330
the whole assumption that the graph can
change as the network is getting used.

86
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:48,300
And so the temperature changes of
the graph needed to be taken into account,

87
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,240
in the algorithms themselves.

88
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,770
Like so when you do the computation,
you have to keep track of the changes.

89
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,600
>> Right.
>> That take place to the graph.

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,930
>> Okay.
>> So that brings in,

91
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,730
in the, the, the temporal graph concept.

92
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,140
And so the algorithms needed to
be re-examined, in that light.

93
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,280
>> Very wonderful.

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,540
And I think your encyclopedia
article on road networks,

95
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,932
is going to be one of
the supplementary readings,.

96
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:13,830
>> Okay. [LAUGH] >> For this course.

97
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,810
So hopefully,
some of that is going to relate back and

98
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,510
they can see the temporal part also.

99
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,590
That is wonderful.

100
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,050
So the next question, you know?

101
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,070
What kinds of things are you working
now a days at Oracle Spartial and

102
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,610
could you also tell us a little bit more
about Oracle Spartial from you know?

103
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,670
As perspective of somebody
working in the group?

104
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,570
>> So our special basically you know,

105
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,370
provides support for article,
for spatial data types.

106
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,140
You know, we do have like you know,
special data types.

107
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,350
Like we support coordinate systems and
and most, commonly used

108
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:54,110
spatial operations like you can find
nearest neighbors, you can you know the,

109
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,560
the fastest route from point A to
point B and stuff like that.

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,540
And also, we do have as
a part of the oracle spatial,

111
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,850
we do have a specialization
tool called Map Viewer.

112
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,510
Which is being extensively used to
visualise, maps and any spatial data for

113
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:14,950
that matter and I specifically work
in the network data model team, so

114
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,820
I was kind of fortunate enough to find
a job, which actually makes use of my

115
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,060
research and, you know, cool to actually,
like, carry my research into the industry.

116
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,800
So I.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,340
work in the network data model team and
the network data model basically,

118
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,250
provides the facilities to represent
networks or graphs in the database.

119
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,560
And so there is a database
representation for networks.

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,650
And on top of that there
are analysis capabilities provided.

121
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,560
So most of the.

122
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Most commonly used graph
operations are being

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,230
offered like weekend computer's pack.

124
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:49,790
>> Okay.

125
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,400
>> We do traveling salesman problem.

126
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,590
>> Okay.

127
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,910
>> And then we do have the network
[INAUDIBLE] of the most

128
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,000
spatial operations.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,545
Like you can find near this neighbors.

130
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:04,440
>> Okay But then cost analysis, drive time
polygons, all based on network costs.

131
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,190
>> Okay, so-

132
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,720
>> That is the basic thing
that our group does.

133
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,420
So what my specific work has been,

134
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,260
again, they're adding a temporal
dimension to the near data model.

135
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,840
>> How wonderful.

136
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,930
>> which it didn't have
a time aspect to it before.

137
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,680
>> Okay.
>> So, making the graphs time aware and

138
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,260
the com,
the network computations time aware.

139
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,080
Actually opens up a lot of possibilities.

140
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,750
For example, the simplest case would
be a traveling salesman problem.

141
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,360
And when you use them as a computing
trucking route to visit like four cities,

142
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,340
if you, if the application is time then we
can actually insist that the trucker get.

143
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,010
Visit a certain city,
in a certain period of time.

144
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,152
And sometimes, that becomes a necessity.

145
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:48,900
>> Like Russia and so on.

146
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,130
>> Yes, Russia was, and also,
there are some, you know, there are some

147
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,220
restrictions like, you need to visit this
particular place but on a certain day.

148
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,830
So you can actually can incorporate
that constraint, if Time of it.

149
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,380
Then, as we mentioned earlier,

150
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,290
the other application would be
incorporating time in such a way that

151
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:13,960
the graph itself is modified and
handled in such a way that it can change.

152
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,930
So the graph changes with time,
for example the condition.

153
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,380
So-
traffic data is out there, now, so.

154
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,070
We do have the facility to incorporate
the changes in the traffic volume as,

155
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,100
during, like at different times of day.

156
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,760
>> Oh, okay.

157
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,970
>> And,
based on that the travel time changes, so

158
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,270
we can actually compute the fastest
time if you start at 8 a.m.

159
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,466
in the morning
>> Oh, wonderful [INAUDIBLE].

160
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,980
[LAUGH]
>> Versus, like, in the midnight.

161
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,380
>> Okay.
>> And you might even get two

162
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,075
different roads when you compute these two
different roads at two different times.

163
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,400
>> [INAUDIBLE].

164
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,010
So, so

165
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,400
I am basically focusing more on the the
temporal aspect of the network data model.

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,260
We also have a little
bit of a support form of

167
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,820
routes which again brings in time
because everything is schedule based.

168
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,428
So you already kind of gave answer to
the next question I was going to ask.

169
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:09,860
[LAUGH] Which was, so, you remember
chapter six in the Spatial Database book,

170
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,470
which had a very basic model of,
transportation networks and

171
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,720
tons of graphs.

172
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,950
So the basic question was,
when you see the.

173
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,320
Graph model or the spatial electric
model in our electric space vehicle,

174
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,080
versus what you see in
the [INAUDIBLE] textbooks,

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,880
what are the things which are common and
what are the things which are different?

176
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,070
>> The basics of the common,
the basics are very common,

177
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,350
we do have nodes that are just nodes and
legs, so we do have entities which are.

178
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,180
Represented by nodes, like which could
be like intersections of roads or

179
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,810
like cities.

180
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,920
But and also like we do have
connections between nodes.

181
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,320
They can be any relationship.

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,360
So in the case of a road network if.

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,280
One node is reachable from another node,

184
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,090
we connect them through using an edge or
a link.

185
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,990
So in the basic debt work
data model in article on,

186
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,830
so like, we do have node table, which is
a database at a percentage of nodes and

187
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,450
the link table which actually provides
the connectivity between nodes and but.

188
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,100
Right now.

189
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,300
The things is, like you know?

190
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,220
The, the text book model actually
treats the graph as static.

191
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,490
>> Okay.
>> Nothing changes.

192
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,080
>> Okay.
>> So,

193
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,820
you do have one edge between node one and
node two.

194
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,240
And you actually.

195
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,440
Have one parameter called
cost on that link.

196
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,280
So the underlying assumption is
that the cost doesn't change.

197
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,260
>> Okay.
>> But

198
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,070
we do have a mechanism right now
to actually represent the cost in

199
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,330
such a way that it actually shows
a variation with respect to time.

200
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,100
>> That's wonderful.

201
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,860
>> So that is, that is one of the most
striking differences I would say.

202
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,140
It has.
>> Indeed, indeed, wonderful.

203
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,850
And I think your encyclopedia article
gives a little glimpse of that.

204
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,490
>> Sure.

205
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,500
Wonderful.

206
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,520
Now looking ahead, you know,
next five to seven years, what

207
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,200
are the major directions in Oracle Spatial
and you know, in your own networks module.

208
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,450
>> I think, when I think about it in
a very generic way I think like you know,

209
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,040
to go more on.

210
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,380
To kind of like,.

211
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,230
Expand more on this
changing graph paradigm.

212
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,820
People are collecting data every day.

213
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,610
And you know, like in a, if you use a, you
know, an online navigation system like,

214
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,830
and everybody's like, saying that okay.

215
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,770
If I don't take this road because
it's congested and, you know,

216
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,310
this is the travel time and, you know, so.

217
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,820
And, and big companies like no,
Nokia's like putting data out there.

218
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
So, there is a lot of data coming in.

219
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,770
>> Okay.
>> And so.

220
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,430
We need to some how
incorporate this into our

221
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,280
computations to make
computations more meaningful.

222
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,020
>> Okay.

223
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,910
So I think we need to have a mechanism
to somehow use this data meaningfully,

224
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,540
but at the same time it's the volume
is growing so drastically.

225
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,220
So we need to do somehow make
the computation section.

226
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,200
So I think big data is here, you know so

227
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,780
that I think that,
that is going to sort of like.

228
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,810
Creeping every where.

229
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,250
>> Yeah. Okay. >> So,
we need to explore that.

230
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,170
>> Okay.
>> And how we

231
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,990
can actually incorporate the big data
analytics into network competition.

232
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,460
Which is not that easy.

233
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,530
>> Okay.
>> Because networks are not that easily.

234
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,750
Partitioned, you know, sensibly.

235
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,780
So we need to figure out how to
partition networks sensibly, so

236
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,030
that we don't have too much communication
going on between the nodes.

237
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,070
>> Okay.
>> And,

238
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,920
also that we don't sacrifice
too much of accuracy.

239
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,750
Mining is a different issue,
because I think mining, you know,

240
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,740
as long as you find out the trends, it's
okay, but with networks, you know it's.

241
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,600
Still a tough problem how to let.

242
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,530
And then also like we need to
adopt our algorithms also to

243
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,040
sort this big data paradigm.

244
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,300
We need to figure how to do that and
even if we don't move into that.

245
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,200
You know,
as the value of the data increases.

246
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,000
It is basically, and

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,040
also even just bringing in time
kind of complicated everything.

248
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,150
>> You explode the data volume, right.

249
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,190
For each instance you may have
a replication of that network.

250
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,010
>> Yeah.
Yeah, and so it is basically, and

251
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,870
also like we cannot apply
the old algorithm techniques.

252
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,470
>> Okay.
Okay.

253
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,100
>> You know, most of the assumptions
that we made with respect to the old.

254
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,400
>> Design can not be applied when
time comes then because most fo

255
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,930
the properties that we relied on to
apple these techniques are breaking.

256
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,630
>> Right.

257
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,285
>> And for example,
like in program to find the best.

258
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:29,771
>> [INAUDIBLE] to answer
the question where to start.

259
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:31,072
So I [CROSSTALK].
>> Oh wow.

260
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:33,770
So, we did,
we did talk about [INAUDIBLE] and A stars,

261
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,040
so what happens to those
when you add time?

262
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,770
>> Because [INAUDIBLE] basically depends
on a property called greedy property, and

263
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,720
which actually depends on a sub-optimal
structure, in, of the final solution,

264
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,380
which breaks when.

265
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,890
When we actually extend
the shortest path question to,

266
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,830
when is the best time to start so
that I spend the least time on the road?

267
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,770
You know, so we are actually talking about
optimising it across, on the graph and

268
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,810
across time too.

269
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,350
So when that comes in, the greedy property
doesn't, is not satisfied anymore.

270
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,940
So I cannot extend.

271
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,530
Extra easily.

272
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,960
>> Yeah, wonderful.

273
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,760
>> yes.
>> Sounds like lot

274
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,540
of interesting opportunities in.

275
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,660
>> Yes.
>> In the area for, or the room for

276
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,940
this area to grow.

277
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,622
>> Yes, for a researcher, yes.

278
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:21,820
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] Wonderful.

279
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,770
So thank you so much Vetsi/b for you know
taking the time to talk to our audience.

280
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,940
And you are in really a sweet spot
where you can look at the research and

281
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,700
also you can bring it to
an influential product.

282
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,620
Which is now being used by really,
really large number of people so.

283
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,660
>> Thank you, thank you for
giving me this opportunity.

284
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,130
This is such an honor and you know, a
great honor to be a part of this project.

285
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,160
Thank you.

286
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,070
>> Thanks.

287
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,640
>> Thank you.

288
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,530
>> Wonderful so so
this was Doctor Betsy George.

289
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,910
A principle in a member technical
staff at Oracle Special.

290
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,310
And in a lot of thing she talked about we
covered in the module on spatial network.

291
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,710
This is a field which all ready
has many applications and

292
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,820
as you heard looks like there will
be many more in coming years.

293
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,050
And hopefully some of the people in
this course will be participating and

294
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,210
shaping this field in the near future.

295
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,190
Thank you and next interview we'll meet
a few of the researchers in this area.
